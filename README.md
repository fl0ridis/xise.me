<h1 align="center">🧑‍💻My Website</a>!</h1><!-- 👋 -->

This is my website, i made it back in 2020 when i was a beginner at Developing, and i have been maintaining it ever since. It is made using CSS,HTML and Javascript but i plan on updating it using React. This Website Utilizes the last.fm API so it can get the Now Playing information. It also utilizes the Wakatime API so it can get the amount of hours spent coding.
